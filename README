The reason why I did not have to give a file extension is because when there is no extension Linux treats it as a "Regular" file which you can write and read to.
reason I like windows:

1. The massive amount of compatibility it has, everything is made for windows
2. The easy of use 
3. better optimized for things that require high performance such as games
4. It provides a sort of continuity between using comptuters because every instance of windows is very simialar
5. Back during the XP/7 days I really liked the organization of the OS

reasons I dislike windows:

1. The lack of true customisation
2. The fact that it is closed source meaning they can be running anything on your machine without your knowledge
3. The way path enviorments work, it is so much simpler on Linux 
4. The fact that it does not use a package manager for its programs 
5. It is also the easiest OS to get a virus on since a majority of virus are created for windows
